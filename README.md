# Docker-compose mysql5.7

Most of the time I use docker to have my environment as close to production as
possible. For that reason I want to access MySQL which is living container via
SequelPro. This repository is created to share with my colleagues and others 
who is interested.

## Install

Execute `docker-compose up -d` to start container

## Connection

To connect to container and login to mysql use next credentials:

| Key      | Value     |
| Host     | 127.0.0.1 |
| Port     | 3306      |
| Username | root      |
| Password | password  |
